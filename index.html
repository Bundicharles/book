              <p>Some stories are not written in chapters but in heartbeats, in the quiet moments that live between yesterday and today. This is our story—Alice and Charles—a journey that began in the dusty fields and bright classrooms of St. Joseph Primary School, and somehow, despite life's winding roads, found its way back home.</p>
              
              <p>I first met Alice in 2015. We were just kids then, full of dreams and curiosity, never imagining that the simplest friendships could one day become something deeper. She was the kind of girl who lit up a room without even trying, and it didn't take long before we became friends. It was natural—effortless. There was this understanding between us, like we had known each other in another lifetime.</p>
              
              <p>Her brother was the Entertainment Captain at our school, and when he left, I somehow found myself stepping into his shoes. It felt like more than a coincidence. Inheriting that role connected me to Alice in a way that even now, I can't quite explain. We were young, but there was something about those days that made everything feel timeless. The laughter, the talks after school, the way we cheered for each other during class group works—it all wove a story I carried with me long after we parted.</p>
              
              <p>At the end of 2018, life did what life often does. We graduated, and our paths split. She went to her high school; I went to mine. And with time, as it tends to happen, contact was lost. Six years passed. Six years of growing up, of learning who we were in a world that had gotten a little bigger and a little louder.</p>
              
              <p>But then, in 2025, as if the universe decided we had waited long enough, our paths crossed again.</p>
              
              <p>For years, I had tried my best to find her on social media, searching for any trace of the girl who had meant so much to me. But every search led to nothing. It was like she had disappeared into the world, just out of reach.</p>
              
              <p>And then, on a quiet Sunday night—March 2, 2025, at exactly 10:41 PM—I saw a WhatsApp notification pop up on my screen. A class reunion group had been created, and there, among the names, was hers. Alice Joy.</p>
              
              <p>I stared at her profile picture for what felt like forever, barely believing that after all these years, she was right there. The universe had finally placed her back in my life. But even then, I didn't know if we would really reconnect—until two days later.</p>
              
              <p>On Tuesday, she called me.</p>
              
              <p>Her voice on the other end of the line was familiar and warm, like a melody I hadn't heard in years but still knew by heart. We arranged to meet at Toll Kimbo, and when I finally saw her in person—the first time in six years—it felt like a dream come true.</p>
              
              <p>The moment I saw her, it was like 2018 had only been yesterday. Alice was still Alice. Her smile, her voice, her spirit—they hadn't changed. And in that instant, I realized neither had my feelings. It wasn't awkward. It wasn't forced. It was a continuation of what we left unfinished all those years ago. It was as if life had hit "pause" and now, finally, pressed "play."</p>
              
              <p>We talked about everything and nothing. We laughed like we used to. The connection was still there—stronger, if anything, because now we were older, wiser, and understood just how rare something like this is.</p>
              
              <p>What are the odds? That two people could find their way back to each other after all that time?</p>
              
              <p>And yet, here we are.</p>
              
              <p>Some love stories don't need grand gestures or dramatic confessions. Some are quiet, steady, and patient. Ours waited for six years. And when we met again, it didn't feel like starting over. It felt like coming home.</p>
              
              <p>Alice Wangui, you are my once-in-a-lifetime. And I am grateful beyond words that life brought us back together—hoping this is for a lifetime.</p>

             <p>After that reunion at Toll Kimbo, something shifted. It started with small conversations—the kind that sneak up on you and stretch into hours without you noticing. Day after day, night after night, we spoke. About everything and nothing. About dreams we once had and the lives we were building now.</p>

<p>Her voice became the music in my day. It was like a ritual—one I couldn’t go without. And somewhere in between those calls, in the gentle silences, the teasing laughter, and the vulnerable confessions, I realized I didn’t just want Alice back in my life.</p>

<p>I wanted her in it. For good.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the conversations felt like we were soulmates in the making. Other times, we clashed—frustrated by the past, by misread words, by fears we didn’t know how to voice. But even in those moments, I didn’t want to let go. I knew this wasn’t just friendship rekindled. It was something deeper—more delicate, more powerful.</p>

<p>She wasn’t just someone I cared about. She was becoming home.</p>

<p>We had planned another class meetup—a simple picnic by the riverside near our old school grounds. It was our second time seeing each other since that night at Toll Kimbo, and I couldn’t stop thinking about her. About the way her presence filled a space. About how everything seemed softer when she was near.</p>

<p>That day, when she arrived, time slowed down.</p>

<p>Alice had a glow about her—like she was lit from the inside out. Her new nose ring sparkled in the sun, and the way she smiled when she spotted me made everything else around us blur. I wanted to freeze that moment and live in it forever.</p>

<p>We talked, laughed, joked with classmates—but I kept stealing glances at her. I noticed the way she moved, the way she threw her head back when she laughed, how she bit her lip when lost in thought. And I wondered—how did I ever survive six years without this?</p>

<p>As the sun dipped low and golden hour painted the sky, we slipped away from the group. Just like old times, just like destiny had always planned it. We walked side by side along the quiet path, where the breeze whispered through the trees and memories lingered in the air.</p>

<p>It wasn’t about the words anymore. It was the silence between them that said everything.</p>

<p>She brushed her hand against mine, and I took it, gently. Her fingers fit into mine like they had always belonged there. I looked at her—and in her eyes, I saw it too.</p>

<p>A spark. A question. A maybe.</p>

<p>We walked until the stars came out, and the laughter of our classmates faded infront far from us. When it was time to say goodbye, I took her to the stage of the evening one last time—where she waited for her ride home.</p>

<p>And before she left, she leaned in, smiled softly, and gave me a peck on the cheek.</p>

<p>A whisper of a kiss.</p>

<p>But to me, it was everything.</p>

<p>Since that day, I haven’t stopped thinking about her. She’s the thought that lingers at sunrise and the prayer I whisper before sleep. And while she still says she’s figuring things out, still not sure what this all means—I’m okay with waiting.</p>

<p>Because for me, the answer is already clear.</p>

<p>It’s her. It’s always been her.</p>

<p>Some stories aren’t loud or flashy. Some don’t need dramatic scenes.<br>
Some are told in stolen glances, in inside jokes, in soft walks under the stars.</p>

<p>Ours is one of those.<br>
And as I write this now, I carry hope—not just for another moment, but for a future.<br>
For a love that began in a classroom, paused by time, and returned more certain than ever.</p>

<p><strong>Alice Wangui</strong>, whatever you decide, just know—you will always be my favorite story.</p>

<p>There are people who come into your life and change everything.</p>            
<p>You are not just someone I care about.</p>

<p>You are the quiet force that holds me together when I'm falling apart.</p>

<p>You are the voice in my head that reminds me I'm not alone—even when you're not here.</p>

<p>You've taught me to believe in good things again, simply because you are one of them.</p>

<p>I could name a hundred little moments where your presence changed something in me—even if you never realized it.</p>

<p>It's the way you really see me—and still choose to stay. It's the way your laughter feels like coming home.</p>

<p>It's the way you make the world softer, brighter, better—just by being in it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I'm afraid I don’t tell you enough. Afraid you’ll never truly grasp how much you saved me, in ways big and small.</p>

<p>But let me say it today: <strong>You are everything.</strong></p>

<p>Not in the way people say it lightly, but in a way that aches—because losing you would tear a hole in my universe.</p>

<p>You are loved—not for what you do, but for who you are.</p>

<p>Hey Alice,</p>

<p>There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you — not to complicate things, but to finally speak from my heart without holding back.</p>

<p>Since we found our way back into each other’s lives, something in me shifted. It’s like I found a piece of peace I didn’t know I was still searching for. Just hearing from you, talking to you, even thinking of you… it’s like the world gets quieter and more beautiful for a moment.</p>

<p>You’re more than just someone I care about. You’re someone I admire deeply — your kindness, your humor, your ambition, the way your eyes light up when you smile. You’ve become someone I dream of having by my side, not just as a passing thought, but in the most serious, real way. When the time is right, I wouldn’t hesitate to ask for your hand. That vision of one day calling you mine, taking you home to share life together — it’s one of my deepest hopes.</p>

<p>But at the same time… I’ve been struggling. Some days, the silence between us makes my heart race with doubt, breaks something in me. I lose sleep. I get stuck in thoughts that spiral. I’ve even thought about disappearing, blocking you, pushing myself away — not because I want to forget you, but because I don’t know how to carry the weight of wanting something so deeply and not knowing if it’s ever going to be mine.</p>

<p>But then I remember your smile, your voice, the light you bring. And somehow, I hang on — even if it’s just by holding onto a photo of you, or the memory of how you welcomed me so warmly. It reminds me that whatever this is, it’s real to me. And that’s worth something.</p>

<p>I’m not asking for answers, or promises. I just needed to say it — honestly, openly, fully. Because you’re worth every word, and this isn’t just a passing crush for me.</p>

      <div class="page-text">
        <p>I don’t know what your heart holds close,<br>
But mine has carved your name like a rose.<br>
In every quiet moment, you appear—<br>
Soft as a whisper, yet crystal clear.</p>

<p>You made me see the man I could be,<br>
Not for the world, but for the love I see.<br>
In the way your smile feels like dawn,<br>
Even when I fear this might be gone.</p>

<p>If love were words, I’d write you skies,<br>
Filled with stars that never lie.<br>
But lately, I walk this path alone,<br>
With questions growing like overgrown stone.</p>

<p>Do you feel it too, or is it just me,<br>
Building castles on what cannot be?<br>
Am I part of your hidden flame,<br>
Or just a shadow calling your name?</p>

<p>So if there's truth behind your eyes,<br>
Let it rise, don’t let it disguise.<br>
For hearts like mine don't ask in vain—<br>
They seek the sun, not love in rain.</p>

        The perfect words I long to speak!<br>

        A tiny screen blocks my surprise.</p>

        <p>You're scrolling memes with focused grace,<br>
        A smile lighting up your face.<br>
        Is it a cat? A dance? A pun?<br>
        My rival's bright, weighs half a ton (of data!).</p>

        <p>I love your laugh, your wit, your style,<br>
        But could you put it down... just for a little while?<br>
        (Then scroll together, side-by-side,<br>
        My place is right here, by your side!)</p>
